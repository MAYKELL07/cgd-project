You'll control your **computer avatar** inside the infected system. Your mission:
1. **Fight the BUGS** - Eliminate virus programs
2. **Close infected WINDOWS** - Reach the X button on each window
3. **Delete corrupted FILES** - Remove hazards blocking your path
4. **Find the VIRUS SOURCE** - Destroy it before it's too late
